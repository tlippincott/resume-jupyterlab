## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

With 15 years of experience in the technology field, I have developed a strong foundation in technical support, troubleshooting, and programming. At SPINS, I enhanced system performance and user satisfaction by diagnosing, debugging, and resolving software-related issues, while also translating complex technical solutions into user-friendly language. I have a proven track record of configuring and managing user accounts, access rights, and system permissions to ensure data security and integrity. My experience delivering training and acting as a subject matter expert allowed me to empower users with technical knowledge, reducing support volume and improving system utilization.

In previous roles with the State of Michigan, I led statewide deployments, provided multi-channel help desk support, and used SQL to resolve access and data-related issues, ensuring operational continuity and compliance. I’ve developed custom tools to automate repetitive help desk tasks, improving efficiency and reducing resolution times. Seeking to shift my career focus, I aim to combine my technical expertise and programming background to assist end users directly, as I transition into a more customer-facing support role. My experience aligns well with Poll Everywhere’s mission, as I am eager to apply my problem-solving skills, technical troubleshooting abilities, and passion for customer satisfaction to enhance the user experience for Poll Everywhere’s clients.
